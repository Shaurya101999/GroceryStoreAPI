# GroceryStoreAPI
For testing purpose I have used REST Client Extension in VS Code, we can send requests
with file request.rest in project

I have connected my db to local Mongo however MongoDb Atlas URI is also there commented 
I have made API's such that all requests have Content-Type: application/json

Phone number acts as a primary key for customer account si it is required for 
every request to fetch and store specific customer data
